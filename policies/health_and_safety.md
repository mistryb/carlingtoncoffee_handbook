## <a name="hazards"></a> Hazards and Dangers in the Workplace
While we don't operate any heavy equipment or do any extremely dangerous jobs, there are a number of hazards and dangers in our coffee shop that everyone should be aware of. They have bee outlined below.

### <a name="heat"></a> Heat
As most of our beverages are served hot, heat can be both a hazard and a danger in the work place. Ensuring that you are both aware and alert while operating our coffee machines will ensure that you stay safe and avoid any burns from hot liquids. 

#### Working Safely with the espresso machine
Our espresso machine in particular generates an incredible amount of heat in the form of both steam and boiling water. Some tips to stay safe when using the espresso machine : 
* Never point the steam wand directly at your skin or body when the machine is operating.
* Avoid looking directly up the steam wand at any time when the machine is on.
* Avoid placing your hand or any other body parts under the porta filter when espressos are being pulled.
* Avoid and horseplay near the espresso machine.
* Never allow untrained staff or patrons to use the espresso machine.

#### Working Safely with the Bunn Batch Brewer
While the batch brewer isn't as complex as the espresso machine, it still produces significant amounts of heat that could cause injury. Here are some tips for operating the batch brewing machine safely.
* Never place your hands or any other body parts under the sprayer while the brewer is in operation.
* Keep a safe distance from the hot water spout when pouring hot water to avoid any hot water splashes on your body.
