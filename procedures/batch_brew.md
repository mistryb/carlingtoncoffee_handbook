The following procedures are to be followed daily upon closing up the shop.
1. Use a small spoonful of powder inside and brew a half batch of hot water only.
2. Mark urn with green tape so no one uses it. 
3. Let sit inside for at least 30 minutes, then scrub inside with a long handled brush. Make sure to get the sides, upper inside lip and bottom of urn. 
4. Dump out water and rinse extensively, leaving no chemical residue.
5. Wash the outside of the urn and lid with hot, soapy water, then rinse.

### <a name="urns_weekly"></a> Weekly Deep Clean
1. Use a small spoonful of powder and brew half a batch of hot water only, and close the lid.
2. Let urn sit on the counter overnight (use a piece of tape to label that there are chemicals inside). 
3. The morning person should only have to dump the urn out and rinse extensively, washing the inside and outside of the urn and the lid, but may have to scrub inside a little bit).

### <a name="daily"></a> Daily Cleaning
1. After urns are cleaned and you are not brewing more drip, turn off the machine.
2. Remove brew baskets, and twist off the inner pieces on the roof of where the drip baskets sit- wash all pieces in hot soapy water and leave on the counter to dry.
3. Spray down the entire outside of the machine with our surface sanitizer and use a clean damp cloth to wipe it down, focusing a lot on the inner roof where the drip baskets sit, the front buttons, and the very top of the machine (this is where dust collects).
4. To polish a stainless steel machine, you can use window cleaner sprayed on a clean cloth, or paper towel/coffee filter, and wipe down the surface of the machine (after it is disinfected!). Or, use stainless steel cleaner.
5. Twist silver brew piece back into the inner roof part, and place the basket back into place, storing our spare basket on top.
6. Prepare some filters for the next day (lightly separate and loosely stack, so they are easy to grab).
7. As a courtesy to your morning opener, pre-weigh one container of each roast of brewed coffee whole beans. Use the small tupperware with blue lids and the scale. Tare the container to 0g, then weigh out the beans as per our measurement. Close the lid tightly. Make sure to use green tape to label the container with the name of the roast, the weight in grams, and the suggested grind setting. For example: Guatemala Medium, 124g, Autodrip. Leave the beans whole, with lids tightly closed and labelled, stacked neatly next to the grinder.
