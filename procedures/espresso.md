**This machine produces immense amount of steam and piping hot water that can be dangerous if not used correctly. Please refer to our [Health and Safety Policy](policies/health_and_safety.md) on how to stay safe when using this machine.**

### Daily Cleaning
#### Espresso Station Pre-close
1. Leave 1-2 steaming pitchers out. Scrub the rest with hot soapy water. Leave to dry overnight
2. Remove syrup bottle lids and clean with hot water. Restock, wipe outsides, put lids on tightly
3. Deep sweep floors behind cash and wipe down all surfaces. 
#### Espresso Machine Pre-Close (Left Side)
1. Remove the portafilter and remove the mesh basket. Wash basket in hot soapy water. 
2.Place blank disk inside the portafilter.
3. Unscrew the screen in the group ( keep the screw in a mug so you don’t lose it!)
4. Clean screen with nylon brush and rinse. 
5. Scrub the inside of the group with nylon brush and wipe with clean, damp cloth.
6. Once all parts are clean, screw the screen back into place.
7. Sprinkle powder inside the blank disk (approx ½ tsp) and put portafilter back in place
8. Back flush water into the group for 8-12 seconds. Carefully remove the portafilter, and dump the water. Repeat this process with fresh powder. Place the portafilter aside.
9. Let hot water run through the group for about 10 seconds.
10. Remove the blank disk from the portafilter. Wash the portafilter and handle well. If needed, you can soak the portafilter in hot water with a touch of powder.
11. Place your clean mesh basket back inside the portafilter. 
12. Wipe down the espresso machine. Use a damp cloth and our surface cleaner to wipe down the front surfaces, backsplash, and the underside of the top of the machine. 
13. Polish machine if needed and place the clean portafilter back into the clean group.
14. Clean the steam wand on that side as well. Dissolve some powder in hot water and soak wand. Use a clean damp cloth to wipe down the steam wand, leaving no residue behind. A stir stick or the back of a spoon can be used to scrape away any solidified milk residue. Steam some plain water to ensure no residue is left behind (careful, as the water will get hot fast!). Clean pitcher well after.
15. Place a piece of tape over your clean group and wand, so you know not to use this side for the rest of the shift. 
#### Espresso Machine Pre-Close (Right Side)
1. Repeat above steps for the right side of the machine after the store is closed.
2. Remove the bottom grate and scrub both sides with hot, soapy water. Wipe the inside of the catch tray as well, and pour hot water down the corners to get rid of any grinds/milk residue. Once everything is clean, place grate back into the tray.
3. Finally, turn off the espresso machine.
4. Scrub any remaining milk pitchers clean and leave upside down in a clean dish rack to dry overnight. Wash any spoons and/or espresso cups that may be dirty as well. 
5. Rinse and ring out all of the cleaning cloths and steam cloths you used today, and hang over the dirty laundry hamper to dry overnight. This will reduce any musty smells before we wash our cleaning cloths. 
6. Using our surface cleaner, wipe down the counter underneath and around the espresso machine. Wipe down the white cupboards and shelves below the espresso machine.
7. Empty grind pucks into compost bin and wash knockbox. Leave to dry overnight.
8. Wash espresso groomer, tamp and tamp mat with hot, soapy water, leave out to dry
9. Empty compost bin when full!
